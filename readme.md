# International user

## What we will cover

* What is an international user?
* Why is a global application hard to make?
* Why is traditional OOP tricky to get right in this application?
* What can we do to make it easier to deal with this problem?

## Notes

Never ever try this at home without the input of a master programmer.

The code you are about to see is a mind experiment of mine that came around
because I have faced this issue before and every solution I have seen
has had big limitations and problems so I wanted to take all those
insights and make something that could work.

This is NOT production tested code in the way that it has been made
but it is very similar to code that has solved this problem in a different
way, I repeat DO NOT build your system with these ideas unless you have
experience with building global systems.

If you are starting your first startup really consider starting with
one country first before you go global, trust me it is easier.
